# Phase 7: Command Integration Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of command integration tools for the Obsidian MCP server, allowing users to list and execute Obsidian commands programmatically.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`src/tools/command.ts`** - New command tools implementation
2. **`src/registerTools.ts`** - Added command tools registration
3. **`tests/tools/command.test.ts`** - Unit tests for command tools
4. **`src/client.ts`** - Already contained required methods (`listCommands`, `executeCommand`)

### API Endpoints

The implementation uses the following Obsidian Local REST API endpoints:

- `GET /commands/` - List all available commands
- `POST /commands/{commandId}/` - Execute a specific command

### Tools Implemented

#### 1. `list_commands`

Lists all available Obsidian commands in the vault.

**Parameters:**
- `vault` (optional): Vault name to use. Uses active vault if not specified.

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
await server.call("list_commands");
await server.call("list_commands", { vault: "my-vault" });
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "editor:save-file",
      "name": "Save current file"
    },
    {
      "id": "editor:follow-link", 
      "name": "Follow link under cursor"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. `execute_command`

Executes a specific Obsidian command by its ID.

**Parameters:**
- `commandId` (required): The ID of the command to execute (e.g., 'editor:save-file')
- `vault` (optional): Vault name to use. Uses active vault if not specified.

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
await server.call("execute_command", { commandId: "editor:save-file" });
await server.call("execute_command", { 
  commandId: "workspace:split-vertical",
  vault: "my-vault" 
});
```

## Client Methods

The `ObsidianClient` class includes these methods for command operations:

### `listCommands(vaultName?: string): Promise<any>`

Retrieves all available commands from the specified vault.

### `executeCommand(commandId: string, vaultName?: string): Promise<any>`

Executes a specific command identified by its ID.

## Error Handling

Both tools implement comprehensive error handling:

- **Network errors**: Connection failures to the Obsidian API
- **API errors**: HTTP error responses (404, 500, etc.)
- **Vault errors**: Missing or invalid vault configurations
- **Command errors**: Invalid command IDs or execution failures

## Testing

Unit tests cover:

- ✅ Successful command listing and execution
- ✅ Multi-vault support with vault parameter
- ✅ API error handling (404, 500, etc.)
- ✅ Network error handling
- ✅ Missing vault configuration handling
- ✅ URL encoding of command IDs
- ✅ Response parsing and formatting

## Common Command IDs

Based on the API examples, common Obsidian commands include:

- `editor:save-file` - Save current file
- `editor:download-attachments` - Download attachments for current file
- `editor:follow-link` - Follow link under cursor
- `editor:open-link-in-new-leaf` - Open link under cursor in new tab
- `workspace:split-vertical` - Split pane vertically

## Integration

The command tools are automatically registered when the MCP server starts through the `registerTools` function in `src/registerTools.ts`.

## Usage Examples

### List Available Commands
```javascript
const commands = await server.call("list_commands");
console.log(commands.commands.map(c => `${c.id}: ${c.name}`));
```

### Execute a Command
```javascript
// Save the current file
await server.call("execute_command", { commandId: "editor:save-file" });

// Split the workspace vertically
await server.call("execute_command", { commandId: "workspace:split-vertical" });
```

### Multi-Vault Usage
```javascript
// List commands in a specific vault
const commands = await server.call("list_commands", { vault: "work-vault" });

// Execute command in a specific vault
await server.call("execute_command", { 
  commandId: "editor:save-file",
  vault: "personal-vault" 
});
```

## Notes

- Command IDs are URL-encoded when making API requests (e.g., `editor:save-file` becomes `editor%3Asave-file`)
- Some commands may return result data, while others return empty responses
- Command execution success is indicated by HTTP 200/204 status codes
- All command operations support the standard vault parameter for multi-vault setups
